# Covid Visualisation

> Motivation

Looking for a project to build my first Tableau Dashboard, of course I had the Covid-19 Dashboards in mind. Here is my small version:

> Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing was done in Python. The aim was to build a pivot table in Python, creating a time series perfectly prepared for Tableau.

See "Covid - DataFrame for Tableau"

In "Covid - Visualisation" I started to create some visualisations with MatPlotLib
